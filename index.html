      <h2>
        I was born and raised in Wichita, Kansas. I'm big on computers, sports,
        and hanging out with family and friends. My interest in computers & tech
        began at a young age, and it's always been my goal to start a career in
        it.

        As seen to the right, there are a few projects that I've completed. I'm fairly new to coding, so I've only got a couple to show, but the list will grow! The large picture is an app called "BeatsDeets" while the smaller one is a website I refactored.
